# Arduino-measurement-system
This system is for measuring low voltage (max 1.25V) from peltier modules with load 25 ohms. Data is written on SD card every minute

Basically you can measure any low-voltage generator with good accuracy (step around 1.0009mV).
You can change values of R1 and R2 to get different range of max voltage.

Feel free use it and change in your program.

Everything what can you measure, can be upgraded.
